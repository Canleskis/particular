# example-bevy

A basic showcase of how Particular can be used with Bevy. This example shows Particular interacting with a simple `PhysicsPlugin` and how it can be used to generate an orbit "preview".  
See the `nbody` module.

- `Left mouse button` to move around the followed body.
- `Mousewheel` to zoom in and out on the followed body.

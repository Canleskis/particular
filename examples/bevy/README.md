# example-bevy

A basic showcase of how Particular can be used with Bevy. This example shows Particular interacting with a simple `PhysicsPlugin` and how it can be used to generate an orbit "preview".  

See the `nbody` module for guidance on utilizing Particular with Bevy and integrating it with a `PhysicsPlugin`.  
Also see the `orbit_prediction` module which showcases an example of orbit "previewing".
